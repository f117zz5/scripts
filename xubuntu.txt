The suspend problem with xubuntu on my asus eee 1005ha

With regards to comment #16:

I have the same problem. The mouse cursor is missing, but the mouse still works. You can see icons, tabs, buttons etc. being highlighted as the mouse passes over it.

You get the pointer back though when you switch to a text tty (ALT-CTRL-F1) and then back to the GUI (ALT-CTRL-F7). You don't need to login to the text terminal.

I've also found that if you disable "Lock on suspend" in the "Light Locker Settings" screen, and then manually lock the screen from the terminal with:

light-locker-command -l

and then close the lid so the laptop suspends, resuming works fine without the need for any workarounds.


could try this too:
